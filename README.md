# Amazon_Vine_Analysis

# Overview of the analysis

_This project's analysis is for a startup marketing company called BigMarket that helps business optimize their marketing efforts. One of BigMarkets’s clients $ellby requested analysis on how the reviews of their products compare to the reviews of similar products sold by their competitors. $ellby is about to realize an extensive catalog of products on a leading retail website. They are also interested in enrolling in a program that gives free products to selected reviewers, but they want to know if it’s worth the cost._ 

_This analysis is based on Amazon reviews written by members of the paid Amazon Vine program. The Amazon Vine program is a service that allows manufacturers and publishers to receive reviews for their products. Companies like $ellBy pay a small fee to Amazon and provide products to Amazon Vine members, who are then required to publish a review._
